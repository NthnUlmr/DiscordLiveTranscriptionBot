{\ttfamily Using} py-\/cord, the bot can gain access to the voice channel you invite it to to listen to your conversation and then poll a speech-\/to-\/text API service to transcribe the conversation in real time. The transcription is separated by user and printed to the output channel in Discord.

{\ttfamily When} you send the bot the shutdown command, it sends a request to Chat\+GPT to summarize the transcription of the conversation. This is then posted to the discord channel.
